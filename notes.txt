Last left off working on....
- login/signup functionality
- navbar spacing ( use fewer shadcn components to fix)
- dark mode styling


Q's for Kaushik:

- After login, user object returned from backend contains 'Message' property
with value 'Login successful'. Is this redundent considering status_codes? 
Currently, I'm just filtering it out before storing the other user data in the 
user session.

Probably need some more fields returned from backend for userdata:
- id
- partner_id (is this a general id? different then the db entry id? use case?)
- first_name
- email
- is_active(? for what use case)
- is_admin, merchant, cutomer
- is_internal (? what is this for? different than admin?)
